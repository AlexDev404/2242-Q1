INSTRUCTIONS: Complete the following tasks - use available slides and Go documentation (examples)

Note: 1. Go has a math package that has many useful math functions
      2. For each question, do a git commit
      3. After you have completed all tasks, push the results to github.
      4. Record a video and send me the link to the video. The link should
         be in a file that is in your GitHub repository.
      5. Share you GitHub repository to me via email. (Subject: 2242-Q1 repo)

1. Create a struct type named 'triangle' that has two fields named
   base and height both of type float64.
   
2. Create a method on type 'triangle' named 'area' that calculates and 
returns the area of a triangle.

3. Create a method on type 'triangle' named 'perimeter' that calculates and 
   returns the perimeter of a triangle.

4. Inside the 'main' function create a variable of type 'triangle'

5. Call the 'area' and 'perimeter' methods on the 'triangle' that you 
   created.
   
6. Create a struct type named 'circle' that has one field named 'radius' of type
float64.

7. Create a method on type 'circle' named 'area' that calculates and
   returns the area of a circle.
   
8. Create a method on type 'circle' named 'perimeter' that calculates and
   returns the area of a circle.
   
9. Write a Go function named 'square' that accepts a parameter of type float64
   that represents the sides of the square.  The 'square' function should return
   the area and the perimeter of the square when called.

10. Write a test for the 'square' function.

EXTRA:

11. Write a test for each of the methods that you created earlier.

12. Implement a shapes interface with area and perimter as its signature methods.
    Make triangle and circle structs part if the shapes interface. modify your code accordingly.
